# Visual-ArtStudio-v1.0
Free painting and design app created to run on Windows PC (requires Windows 8/Windows 8.1 or lower, currently unavailable for Windows 10)
# Details
This is only the free version of the application, so although it doesn't have the full capabilities of ArtStudio Plus (coming soon), it does have many capabilities, such as:

-Drawing (obviously)
-Very basic image editing
-Polygon and shape transformation
-Customizable pen and brush styling
-Dynamic palette and pen adjustment tools
-Special texture and surface styling for pens and polygon edges

And those are just some of ArtStudio's abilities, but the list goes on. ArtStudio can be used as a sketch tool, an icon creation tool, or a fast and easy way to edit a photo.
# Requirements
-Requires Windows 8.1 or earlier as of January 4, 2020. Windows 10 update will be coming soon
-Requires Windows PC or a Windows virtual machine
