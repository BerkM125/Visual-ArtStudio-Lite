# Visual-ArtStudio-Lite
Free painting and design app created to run on Windows PC
# Details
This is only the free version of the application, so although it doesn't have the full capabilities of ArtStudio Plus (coming soon), it does have many capabilities, such as:

- Drawing (obviously)
- Very basic image editing
- Polygon and shape transformation
- Customizable pen and brush styling
- Dynamic palette and pen adjustment tools
- Special texture and surface styling for pens and polygon edges

And those are just some of ArtStudio's abilities, but the list goes on. ArtStudio can be used as a sketch tool, an icon creation tool, or a fast and easy way to edit a photo.
# Requirements
- Requires a machine running Windows Vista or above (Windows 10 is now available as well)
- Requires all files in repository
